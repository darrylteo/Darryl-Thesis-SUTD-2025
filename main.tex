\textit{Reimagining Air Traffic Flow Management (ATFM) --- toward a smarter, more resilient future}. While information sharing and collaborative decision-making are well-established in regions such as the United States and Europe, Southeast Asia continues to operate in a highly decentralized manner, posing significant challenges to the effective implementation of ATFM. A major undertaking to support a transition into a collaborative environment is the Flight \& Flow Information for a Collaborative Environment (FF-ICE) initiative, conceived to eliminate the limitations of the current Flight Plan system.

This dissertation presents the first comprehensive quantitative study of the FF-ICE program, examining the benefits and drawbacks of an incremental FF-ICE R1 implementation in the ASEAN region. Owing to the interconnectivity, complexity, uncertainty, and decentralized nature of the ASEAN airspace, solving the ATFM problem at the scale of the entire region fails to capture the operational nuances, particularly because incremental participation is anticipated. To address this, we introduce a Rolling Horizon Concept (RHC) that more accurately represents varying levels of information sharing and aligns more closely with current operational capabilities.

We present a suite of mathematical models and algorithmic routines designed to simulate decentralized ATFM systems, incorporating key constraints such as airspace capacity and aircraft separation requirements. These algorithms operate independently within each region, using the available information at each time step to optimize ATFM decisions including speed adjustments, ground delay programs and airborne holding.

A realistic simulator of the ASEAN airspace network, supporting information sharing and collaborative decision-making, was developed using the proposed mathematical tools and real airspace data. The results demonstrate significant savings under various collaboration regimes. Notably, partial collaboration, even within a single country, can yield considerable benefits. The results also reveal a surprising consequence of minor collaborations, say between only two airports, that has been shown to erratically impact other flights far from the time which collaborative measures take place.

First and foremost, I would like to thank Prof PJ for believing in me, and giving me this amazing opportunity to pursue the PhD. To Prof PJ: From day one until now, I could not have asked for a better mentor, who exhibits the values of care, integrity, industriousness, friendliness and beyond. The way you treat everyone with respect, regardless of social status, has left a deep impression on me, and I strive to follow in your footsteps. Also, no matter how busy you were, you always found time to respond and help me with my tasks or personal matters, and I am extremely grateful for your generosity with time. I have grown so much in the past few years thanks to your mentorship, developing as a better researcher, as well as a better human, and I endeavor to emulate your example! Wishing you and your family good health and happiness.

Next, I would like to thank Prof Nuno for advising my PhD for the past two years, and always offering advice and help whenever I needed it. I thank you for the knowledge you have imparted, and guidance you have generously offered over the many years we have known each other. To Prof Nuno: I am continually impressed by your ability to analyze data and offer insights that few others can. Your ability to create convincing arguments is truly admirable. I am deeply grateful to have learned from you --— your mentorship has greatly boosted my confidence in presenting and articulating my ideas. Furthermore, during our conversations, I feel as if I am talking to another Singaporean; your ability and adapt and thrive in new surroundings is a powerful and enviable trait. The stories of your adventures overseas have never failed to captivate me and opened my eyes to how big the world is. Thank you so much for your guidance and I look forward to future collaborations together.

I would like to thank Prof Daniel for hosting me at Ecole Nationale de l'Aviation Civile. To Prof Daniel: Thank you for taking care of me during my stay in Toulouse, France, and beyond. It was my first time living abroad, and while scary at first, my fears dissipated soon after, in no small part due to your warmth and kindness. Your vast knowledge on aviation and reputation in the field has left me starstruck, and I am proud to have you as my mentor. In addition, your physical ability is extremely impressive --- the intensity of your cycles and mountain climbing, and frequent travels, has become a tale of legends in my book. Thank you for dropping by whenever you visit Singapore too, I am always happy to see you again. Wishing you good health, and safe travels! Merci beaucoup!

I also wish to express my heartfelt gratitude to Chen Sin Chee, for being the best graduate studies manager. He has always gone above and beyond to help me whenever I face any difficulty in any administrative or personal matters. Thank you to Prof Jeffery Chan for the interesting discussions during the ethics class, and encouraging me to enroll into the PhD program. Thank you to Cecilia Radhalechumi, Samantha Septribellina, Lim Lee Chen, and Tan Siew Gan for always helping to schedule meetings and other admin matters; there has been 0 hiccups as far as I recall, amazing! Thank you to Prof Bikramjit Das and Prof Stefano Galelli for providing guidance during my term as your teaching assistant. Thank you to Li Hongbo and Ruan Yanqiu for the teamwork and support as friends and groupmates during the PhD coursework. Thank you to my project mates over the past few years --- Gengling Dai, Rakesh Nandi, Wang Weimeng, Ho Huiqi, Chua Wanyun, Faye Chiang; you have been the most amazing people to work with. Thank you to everyone in the ESD office for the welcoming environment, especially during my undergrad days. Thank you to everyone in the ASI office for making it an enjoyable place to work. Thank you to the PhD matters office for the smooth processing of all the overseas attachments and conferences I have attended. I would like to extend my sincere thanks to everyone I had the pleasure of interacting with during my time at SUTD. My experience has left me with a lasting impression of SUTD as a highly efficient research institution that offers world-class education and is home to exceptionally capable and welcoming staff and students.

I would also like to thank SUTD for the generous funding provided under the PGF(CIS) scholarship, and CAAS for funding many projects within the ASI.

Last but not least, I would like to thank God, and my family. I thank the Lord for blessing me with this opportunity, and keeping me from harm; I will seek your ways in all seasons of life. \textit{The heart of man plans his way, but the LORD establishes his steps. -Proverbs 16:9}. To my family: Home is where the heart is, and my heart lies with you. Thank you for being there for me, supporting and encouraging me always; the love and warmth of our family is irreplaceable.  My mother's favorite quote: "A watermelon in a box will end up square.". Given that the shape of a watermelon is determined by its surroundings, I hope to pursue the next chapter of my life in an environment that positively shapes my personal and professional life and do you proud.
