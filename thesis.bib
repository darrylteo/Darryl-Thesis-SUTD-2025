It sequences the machines one by one, successively, taking each time the machine identified as a bottleneck among the machines not yet sequenced. Every time after a new machine is sequenced, all previously established sequences are locally reoptimized. Both the bottleneck identification and the local reoptimization procedures are based on repeatedly solving certain one-machine scheduling problems. Besides this straight version of the Shifting Bottleneck Procedure, we have also implemented a version that applies the procedure to the nodes of a partial search tree. Computational testing shows that our approach yields consistently better results than other procedures discussed in the literature. A high point of our computational testing occurred when the enumerative version of the Shifting Bottleneck Procedure found in a little over five minutes an optimal schedule to a notorious ten machines/ten jobs problem on which many algorithms have been run for hours without finding an optimal solution.},

  abstract = {Functional airspace blocks (FAB) concept is adopted by the European airspace to allows cooperation between airspace users to manage the air trafﬁc ﬂow, while ensuring efﬁciency, safety, and fairness without constraints of geographical boundaries. This integration of airspace introduces more ﬂexibility to manage aircraft trajectory and airspace usage. In this paper, we propose a distributed air trafﬁc ﬂow management model to address four-dimensional trajectory planning over the European FAB. The goal is to enable effective information sharing between airspace blocks in strategic planning, and to minimize interaction between trajectories. The proposed model and overall methodology is implemented and tested with a full day air trafﬁc data over the European airspace. Interaction-free 4D trajectories are produced within computational time acceptable for the operational context, which shows the viability of the distributed model and interaction minimization approach for effective FAB implementation.},

Given ﬂight-speciﬁc operating and delay costs, the proposed approach uses column generation to determine optimal trajectories in space and time in the presence of network and ﬂight connectivity constraints as well as airport and airspace capacity constraints. Ground holds, airborne delays, reroutes and cancellations are considered as possible control actions. The approach is then extended to generate recourse strategies in the presence of uncertain capacity constraints, which are represented using probabilistic scenario trees. A scalable, parallel implementation of our approach is used to solve nation-scale examples from the United States, showing that the approach is fast enough for real-time implementation.},

The ATC system is modeled as a network of queueing systems. Flights are generated from a flight schedule, a text file created by the simulation scenario designer. The simulator supports the following flow control actions: ground holds, airborne holds, speed control, and rerouting. Tools are included for schedule generation and statistical analysis. The design of a scenario requires a working knowledge of Lisp. This thesis includes an overview of the flow management problem, a discussion of modeling issues and design considerations, a description of the implementation of the simulator in moderate detail, results from a sample simulation scenario which includes a simple flow management strategy, and suggestions for possible improvements to the simulator.},

  year       = {2012},

  abstract   = {The cost of air traffic delays is well documented, and furthermore, it is known that the significant proportion of delays is incurred at airports. Much of the air traffic flow management literature focuses on traffic flows between airports in a network, and when studies have focused on optimizing airport operations, they have focused largely on a single aspect at a time. In this thesis, we fill an important gap in the literature by proposing unified approaches, on both strategic and tactical levels, to optimizing the traffic flowing through an airport. In particular, we consider the entirety of key problems faced at an airport: a) selecting a runway configuration sequence; b) determining the balance of arrivals and departures to be served; c) assigning flights to runways and determining their sequence; d) determining the gate-holding duration of departures and speedcontrol of arrivals; and e) routing flights to their assigned runway and onwards within the terminal area. In the first part, we propose an optimization approach to solve in a unified manner the strategic problems (a) and (b) above, which are addressed manually today, despite their importance. We extend the model to consider a group of neighboring airports where operations at different airports impact each other due to shared airspace. We then consider a more tactical, flight-by-flight, level of optimization, and present a novel approach to optimizing the entire Airport Operations Optimization Problem, made up of subproblems (a) - (e) above. Until present, these have been studied mainly in isolation, but we present a framework which is both unified and tractable, allowing the possibility of system-optimal solutions in a practical amount of time. Finally, we extend the models to consider the key uncertainties in a practical implementation of our methodologies, using robust and stochastic optimization. Notable uncertainties are the availability of runways for use, and flights' earliest possible touchdown/takeoff times. We then analyze the inherent trade-off between robustness and optimality. Computational experience using historic and manufactured datasets demonstrates that our approaches are computationally tractable in a practical sense, and could result in cost benefits of at least 10\% over current practice.},
